Ethical Implications: 

Creating a duplicate of a social media application bears a variety of ethical and professional reponisbilites. As engineerig students working on such a project, security, safety and overall privacy of the application's user must be of upmost importance. Global, economic, evironmental and social impacts must be considered as well. 

One modern ethical and professioan responsility when building a social media application is ensuring the privacy of the user and the user's data confidentiality. To ensure the user of their privacy, proper security protocols must be implemented and maintained as long as the application exists. Current social media applications are transperant with their users and disloce what they do with their personal data. These protocols include attaining the consent of the user for the application to collect the data and publishing application's most current security policies that explains how data is being managed.  

Other important responsibilites that arrise from creating a social media appliocation is the glonal, economic, environmental and social impacts. Social media application have had a massive impact on the global economy from hiring personel to build the application to advertisments and marketing. Natural resources expended to create a social media application such as electricity consumption have enviromental impacts. With the increase of social media applications as a main source of communication around the world, the societal impact is now more apparent than ever. As an engineer, it is crucial to not only develop an application that is secure in temrs of user data and confidentiality but also consider the positive and neative impact it can have on a global scale. 

Overall, bulding a social media application involved a tremendous amount of team work, and requires the team to prioritize the security and confidentiality of the user's information. Creating a social media application extends past the application itself as its exisitance can provoke positive, and sometimes negative, social, environmental and fincancial impacts on a global scale.
